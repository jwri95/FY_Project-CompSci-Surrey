# personal_project
Git repository for my personal project (COM3001)

This is a Unity project made for Oculus Quest VR headset, a car simulation where the user has to react to the car in-front braking whilst performing specific tasks depending on the sat-nav system used. It was built as part of a study on how satellite navigation systems can affect a driver's reaction times to specific stimuli, and which types are more or less effective than others in communicating the directions.

This is a re-upload as I do not have access to my university github account (jw01324) anymore.
